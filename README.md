Spam filtering assignment for project 2 in data practicum.

Here's a command to run the SMTrainer with the "vsmall" document data
from p1 and using unsophisticated conversion (i.e. - 200 iterations, no more and no less...)

`python SMTrainer.py -i data/Reuters/X_train_vsmall.txt -l data/Reuters/y_train_vsmall.txt -o some -t data/Reuters/X_test_vsmall.txt data/Reuters/y_test_vsmall.txt -d`
